---Binds a virtual gamepad input to a button, axis or hat for all Joysticks of a certain type. For example, if this function is used with a GUID returned by a Dualshock 3 controller in OS X, the binding will affect Joystick:getGamepadAxis and Joystick:isGamepadDown for ''all'' Dualshock 3 controllers used with the game when run in OS X.
---
---LÃ–VE includes built-in gamepad bindings for many common controllers. This function lets you change the bindings or add new ones for types of Joysticks which aren't recognized as gamepads by default.
